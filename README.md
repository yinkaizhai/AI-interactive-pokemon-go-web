## Features

- Interactive map with randomly spawning Pokemon
- Hand gesture-based Pokeball throwing mechanics
- AI-powered interactive capture experience
- Location-based gameplay
- Beautiful visual effects and animations
- Mobile-friendly design

## Technologies Used

- Three.js for 3D graphics
- MediaPipe for AI hand tracking and gesture recognition
- Mapbox for map integration
- HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- Modern CSS3 for animations and styling
- Vanilla JavaScript for game logic

## Prerequisites

- Modern web browser with WebGL support
- Camera access for AI hand tracking
- Internet connection for map data
- Your own Mapbox API token

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yinkaizhai/AI-interactive-pokemon-go-web.git
cd AI-interactive-pokemon-go-web
```

2. Download Pokemon GIF assets:
   - Download the GIF pack from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xWZTGFYTEHtn_bqpcQE4DPcoNG7zZYLn/view?usp=drive_link)
   - Extract and place all GIF files in the `src/assets/gifs` directory
   - **Important**: The `src/assets/gifs` directory is not included in the repository due to size constraints. You must download and add these files manually.

3. Configure Mapbox:
   - Sign up for a Mapbox account at https://www.mapbox.com
   - Create your API token
   - Replace the token in `src/js/map.js`:
     ```javascript
     mapboxgl.accessToken = 'YOUR_MAPBOX_TOKEN';
     ```

4. Serve the project:
   - Use a local development server (e.g., Live Server in VS Code)
   - Or use Python's built-in server:
     ```bash
     python -m http.server 8000
     ```

5. Open in browser:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`
   - Grant camera permissions when prompted

## Usage

1. Allow camera access when prompted
2. Look for Pokemon markers on the map
3. Click a Pokemon to enter capture mode
4. Use hand gestures to throw Pokeballs:
   - Make a grabbing gesture to hold the Pokeball
   - Move your hand up and forward to throw
   - Time your throw to hit the Pokemon!
